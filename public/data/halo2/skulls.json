    "location": "Progress through Delta Halo until you come to an area with a large central structure that has a multitude of columns (the place with the many stationary shield generators). This is the area where Cortana tells you that they are all pouring out of the middle. When you first get into this area, you have to go left, and there is a ramp on the left that goes up and then back down. Get on this ramp and continue up the wall until you are on the landing where there will be (or used to be) some Plasma Turrets. Follow this landing all the way to its end, and you'll see a door that is blocked off by a large stone. Jump on top of the stone, and jump again to get on a thin ledge. Make sure you're up against the left wall, and Grenade Jump up to the top of the wall to your left. Once you're on this wall, you'll see that the right wall ends and there is some earth behind it. Jump onto the dirt, and follow the stone wall all the way to the top. When you're on the top of this wall, you can look down towards the center and you should see two Stealth Elites repeating their \"angry stance\" towards each other with the Envy skull between them. (Note: They will not attack you, even if you shoot at them. But if they are killed they will fire their weapons randomly before they hit the ground, which can hurt you). Another way of getting the Skull is to grenade the stone away from the door. For that, you'll need all the Fragmentation and Plasma Grenades you can carry, sometimes even more (using rocket launcher and having the Sputnik skull would be helpful). Throw each of them into the corner behind the stone. Every time a grenade explodes, the stone will move a little. You'll never get it fully out of the way, but after about eight or nine grenades, there will be enough space to go through the door. Alternatively jump on the rock and throw one Plasma Grenade in the corner behind the rock. This should move it enough so that you can drop into the crack and melee the rock until the doorway is clear. If not, throw a couple more grenades. If you do not have any grenades or rocket launcher ammo, use a Scorpion or Wraith to blast the stone away. This method leads you up a ramp and into a room open to one side where you'll find two dead Grunts along with two Energy Swords (an Easter Egg which implies that these two Grunts accidentally killed themselves with the Swords). Exit the room and you'll be on a platform above the normal area. Grenade jump towards the room you just exited, and you'll be with the Stealth Elites and the Envy Skull. ",

    "location": "The skull can be found on the level Outskirts when playing on Legendary. This skull has a one in seven chance of spawning (referenced by the \"1\" and \"7\" posters in the room containing the skull) when the game loads the Jackal snipers in the alley after the clearing where Johnson is picked up in the pelican. You may skip the entirety of the encounters up to the sniper alley by using the rooftops. The following guide is a fast route to the skull with safety checkpoints. It is strongly advised that you activate the permanent invisibility glitch for this. From the beginning of Outskirts, run into the first hallway and then look overhead. You will see two lights on either side of the hallway. Jump on to one of them, and then crouch jump up to the higher platform. From there turn around and run along the ledge to the right of the alleyway below. Across from it, you will see another platform. Jump to it, then Grenade Jump or double jump onto yet another higher level. From there, look left and you will see a nearby rooftop, jump to it; go to the right and head down that alley, where you'll be able to jump onto the higher rooftop. Continue to the other side of the rooftop and drop down to the street. Turn right and head toward the open area, where you can hide from the Jackals' fire behind the large truck. Once you hear that the Jackals have been killed by your allies, you can head towards the ramp ahead, but DO NOT go past the top of the ramp. Wait for the checkpoint if it hasn't happened already, then save and quit the game. This checkpoint is before the Jackal snipers in the alley are spawned, which is when the game calculates the random chance of whether the skull spawns or not. This is the checkpoint you will reload if the skull does not spawn. Unfortunately, the game automatically checkpoints a little bit after you enter the alley as well, locking in the \"dice roll\" of the skull spawn. It is important that this checkpoint is skipped, which you can do by constantly meleeing as you run through this next part. As long as you are meleeing, the game will not save a checkpoint. If it does checkpoint, you can exit the game entirely without saving (turning off the console) and reload your saved checkpoint, or kill yourself five times quickly to revert to the pre-alley checkpoint. Head through the alley, and you should see a dumpster to your right. Jump onto the dumpster and onto the nearby roof. Jump onto the pipes attactched to the wall, onto the platform, and then leap to the roof across the alley. Head diagonally forward and right onto the roof just past bridge-like structure and turn left. You should see a balcony across the alley with a doorway. Stop meleeing now. Enter this doorway and look at the ground to the right. Wait about ten seconds. A checkpoint will occur, and the skull may or not appear at the same time as the checkpoint. If there is no skull, reload the pre-alley checkpoint, either by killing yourself five times or by quitting the game without saving, and try again. If you want to save the Skull, (in case you fail in the fight with the Elites) you should exit the room and proceed to get another checkpoint. Save and quit. Restart and go back to room with the Skull. It will always be there. When you grab the Skull, you'll be transported into the alley. You will have only a Plasma Pistol, and must fight off seven waves of Ultra Elites (wave one starting with one Elite, wave two with two Elites, and so on). ",
