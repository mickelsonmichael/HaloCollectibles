# Halo: Reach - Data Pads

## Winter Contingency

### Data Pad 01

*Legendary Only*. This datapad is found on an invisible Elite within the first few moments of the game. As soon as you gain control of your character.
Sprint down the hillside towards the distress beacon and kill the Elite before it runs away and the datapad will be on its back.

### Data Pad 02

Once you reach the vehicle section of the level, follow the left wall until you cross a bridge. You will then find a cluster of buildings; inside the rightmost building there will be several bodies, with the datapad lying among them.
